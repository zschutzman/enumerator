    "# About this code\n",
    "This is the start of an enumerator for the valid Congressional districting plans of the state of Iowa.  Iowa (currently) is apportioned four Congressional districts and the state laws prohibit *the splitting of counties* in forming such plans.  Since there are 99 counties in Iowa arranged in a roughly grid-like pattern and we have had [some success in enumerating partitions of grid graphs](https://github.com/zschutzman/enumerator), it seems a natural question to ask whether or not we can do the same for Iowa.  Curious readers are encouraged to take a look at the enumeration strategy for the grid graph, as this setting, which is only a slight modification, provides an excellent test case for the limitations of that method.\n",
    "\n",
    "New in this setting is the population constraint.  Legally, each district must have (nearly) the same number of people.  We have population data for the counties of Iowa and we need to endow the graph with that information in order to evaluate whether a districting plan is legal or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, the strategy for enumeration will be the same.  We'll first enumerate all of the valid individual districts, where validity is determined by having the appropriate population, being geographically connected, and not creating any unfillable holes."
