    "This is an enumerator for the connected partitions of grid graphs. We might ask how many ways there are to cut an $m\\times n$ grid into $k$ connected pieces, where we can consider both *rook* connectivity, meaning that two squares are considered adjacent if and only if they meet at an edge, and *queen* connectivity where we also consider two squares which meet at a corner to be adjacent.\n",

    "There are a very large number of such partitions.  For the $7\\times 7$ grid, there are almost 150 million ways to partition it into seven rook-connected pieces of size seven.  However, for smaller instances of the problem, we can count the number of such partitions relatively quickly, and that is what this code does.  We include the option to actually output the list of partitions as well.\n",

    "### The Julia Language\n",
    "This code is written in Julia, a relatively new language designed by some cool folks at MIT for scientific and numerical applications.  Julia blends the usability of Python with the (almost) speed of C with a MATLAB-like syntax.  It is just-in-time compiled, so it's not unusual for the first execution of a method (what functions and stuff are called in Julia) to be slow, since the compiler needs to do its thing, but subsequent calls are fast.  As a relative benchmark, this exact same algorithm in Python runs about ten times slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia is functional rather than object-oriented like Python, and it's typing, polymorphic methods, and homoiconism are really cool and let you do some neat things, and I definitely recommend checking out more of the language's features if you're interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation of this algorithm in Python runs about 10 times slower than this code.  [Bob Harris' C implementation](http://www.bumblebeagle.org/polyominoes/tilingcounting/) runs at a similar speed to this Julia code for the smaller examples.  For larger examples, Harris' code is faster and more memory-efficient, but it only counts partitions; it cannot output the enumeration."

However, this method is also somewhat obviously slow, since there are a very large number of binary matrices and relatively few of them are valid ominos.  By making the observation that any $(k+1)$-omino can be thought of by adding one cell to a $k$-omino, we can dramatically decrease the time needed to construct the omino sets.  This is what the following method, `biggen()` does -- it takes a set of ominos and returns the set of ominos reachable by augmenting something in that set.\n",

    "If we start with the set of $1$-ominos on a grid (the set of $m\\times n$ binary matrices with a single one and call `biggen()` recursively $k-1$ times, we can construct every $k$-omino.  The proof is by induction, and follows immediately from the above observation.  Since every $(k+1)$-omino is an augmented $k$-omino, if we know we have the complete set of $k$-ominos, then `biggen()` will yield the complete set of $(k+1)$-ominos.

    "### Defining the tree structure\n",
    "\n",
    "We now make another observation: given any partitioning into ominos, we can canonically order those ominos by reading them off of the grid left-to-right, top-to-bottom.  Each partition has a unique canonical order, which is going to prevent us from double-counting any partitions as we go along.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this ordering, we can talk about *partial partitions* in a meaningful way.  We define a partial partition to be the truncation of a complete partition.  For example, if $o_1,o_2,o_3,o_4$ is a full partition into four pieces, then $o_1,o_2$ is its (unique) length-two partial partition.  By the construction of the canonical ordering, we can also observe that if $o_i$ and $o_j$ are two ominos which appear together in some plan, then either $o_i$ *always* precedes $o_j$ or $o_j$ *always* precedes $o_i$ in any plan.  This is because if we have some plan where $o_i$ precedes $o_j$, then it must be the case that some cell of $o_i$ occurs before some cell of $o_j$ in the left-to-right, top-to-bottom ordering of the grid, so in every canonical ordering of any partition including both $o_i$ and $o_j$, $o_i$ comes first.\n",
    "\n",
    "This uniqueness lets us imagine a tree structure on the set of valid partitions.  The root is the empty list, which is the unique length-zero partial partition and is the length-zero partial partition for every partition.  The leaves of the tree are the valid partitions which we are trying to enumerate.  The level-$i$ nodes correspond to length-$i$ partial partitions, and since the canonical ordering of the chunks of a partition induce a well-defined partial order on the ominos, this tree structure is well-defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our next trick to pare down the search space is to build a dictionary of conflicts which tells us which ominos are compatible with which other ominos.  If there are two ominos which overlap or lead to an unfillable hole, it's a huge waste of time to try to explore partial plans which contain both of them, so this dictionary helps us avoid that.  We'll say that two ominos are compatible if they do not overlap and their combination doesn't result in a partial plan which has unfillable holes.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we're here, we're also going to build a dictionary which, for each entry of the grid, tells us the collection of ominos which have their first one in that entry.
